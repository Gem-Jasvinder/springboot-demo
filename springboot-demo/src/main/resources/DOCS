Step-3: Commands to run the Container from the image we create above
               docker run DockerImage_Name

//if you are using some port in your application than you have to map it with your local machine
                docker run --publish containerPort:hostMachinePort DockerImage_Name
                ex-(docker run --publish 8080:8080 DockerImage_Name)

//TO see the running Containers
                docker ps

//TO see the all containers
            docker ps -a

//TO  remove the the containers
            docker rm containerName
            OR
